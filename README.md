# 1337
1337 is a small program made just for fun to convert plain text and 1337 language to one another.

A makefile is provided.

Both to1337 and toplain use standard inputs and outputs.

When converting from plain to 1337 and several translations are possible,
one is chosen at random.

The exact specification of the language is listed in the file 1337.txt
(there actually might be some small differences, I didn't really bother checking).

I'm pretty sure the language conversion is bijective, but I could be wrong..
